Usage: stubby-db [OPTION]... 
Runs stubbyDB server

Arguments
  -p, --port                 port number
  --host                     Host name
  -m, --mapping		     file path of yaml mapping file (response.yaml)
  -s, --stub                 path for stubs only if mapping file has relative path and they are not in current folder
  -c, --config               name of config file. It must be json file.
  -C                         json config as command line argument
  -h, --help                 display on screen help
  -d                         location of project directory, if it is not a current directory.
  -q, --quite                Under development
                             all    - turn off on screen logging
                             info   - turn off on screen logging for info only
                             error  - turn off on screen logging for error only

Considerations:
if -p, -m, -s options are given then relevant properties from config file would be ignored;
Precedence of loding config is -p,-m-s > -c > -C > -d > default

Default config:
if no option is given then
1. check for config.json in current folder
2. otherwise check for 'dbsets', 'mappings', 'stubs' folder in currrent directory. and set port to 7777.

Note:
-c, --config    The purpose of this option to choose different config file instead of config.json from current directory. But if you specify different location then run stubby-db from that location only. Or maintain absolute paths in config.json for dbsets, mappings, and stubs.

Project directory structure:

Project
 |_ dbsets
 |_ dumps
 |_ mappings
 |_ stubs
 |_ logs
